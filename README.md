Description
    - what
    - why
    - how

    - This website was created to serve as a workday scheduler that is user friendly and on which a user can schedule his or her day.

    - It is meant to be a planner-at-a-glance.

    - This website was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap formatting to provide ease-of-use and quick access.

    --- As per the assignment:

    -- The HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap coding has been provided for the sake of the assignment to form the elements of the website.
    -- The Javascript, and JQuery coding has been built from scratch to provide the website with functionality.

    - This was done using elements such as: functions, variables, for loops, intervals, if statements, querySelectors, DOM manipulation, localstorage.getItem/localstorage.setItem, and eventListeners.

    - A few places for user input has been added for each hour of the workday (09;00AM to 05:00PM).

    - Once data has been typed in, a save button to the right can be clicked to add said data to the local storage.

    - On page startup, the local storage is called to fill in the planner with what has been previously submitted.

    - Also on page startup, the elements of the page become color coded to show which hours have gone by, what hour it is, and which hours are to come.

    -A clock has been added at the top under the title and description to show the current time down to the minute.

    This website was coded by Dylan Storm Johnson.
